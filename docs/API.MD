## ReduxAsyncConnect
It allows to delay route transition until all promises returned by reduxAsyncConnect methods of components defined within corresponding route are resolved or rejected.

#### Props
##### `components` (required)
The list of components corresponding current route. It not instances...
Usually it is provided by react Router component or match method from react router.

##### `params` (required)
Router params.
Usually it is provided by react Router component or match method from react router.

##### `render` (required)
Function that accepts props and uses to render components.
Usually it's just <RouterContext {...props} /> (by default)

##### `helpers`
Any helpers you may want pass to your reduxAsyncConnect static method.
For example some fetching library.

## asyncConnect decorator

```js
asyncConnect(AsyncProps: Array, mapStateToProps?, mapDispatchToProps?, mergeProps?, options?)
```

Signature now corresponds to [react-redux connect](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options)

This is the function that uses to decorate your container components that is connected with router.
It takes an array of asyncItem objects, each item with two properties:

-  'key'  (string); 
-  'promise' (function, usually returning a Promise)

```js
@asyncConnect([{
  key: 'lunches',
  promise: (params, helpers) => helpers.client.get('/lunches'),
}])
export default class Home extends Component {
  // ...
}
```

The interface is similar to react-redux connect. The key of each asyncItem object will be used to connect data returned from from promise to corresponding prop in the component.
So in example above you'll have this.props.lunches

The value of each ayncItem 'key' should be a string identifier which will become a key on reduxAsyncConnect redux state tree.
The value of each asyncItem 'promise' should *usually be a promise* that accepts params from router and helpers

...it also accepts State. Params has more than just router params, which are actually params.params. @makeomatic, can you clarify documentation? See your comment: https://github.com/Rezonans/redux-async-connect/issues/16#issuecomment-184404969.

Redux store exists in helpers by default.
This 'promise' function can return:
- _**undefined**_ In this case we'll do nothing
- _**promise**_ In this case ReduxAsyncConnect will DELAY RENDERING before storing data from this promise to redux state to appropriate key.
- _**other value**_ In this case we will NOT DELAY RENDERING and instead immediately store this data to redux state to appropriate key.

## reducer
This reducer MUST be mounted to `reduxAsyncConnect` key in combineReducers.
It uses to store information about global loading and all other data to redux store.

## redux state
You'll have the following in your `reduxAsyncConnect` key in redux state:
_(the [key] here is corresponding to mapStateToProps object's keys passed to asyncConnect decorator)_

- _**loaded**_ It's global loading identifier. Useful for page preloader
- _**[key].loading**_ Identifies that promise resolving in progress
- _**[key].loaded**_ Identifies that promise was resolved
- _**[key].data**_ Data, returned from resolved promise
- _**[key].error**_ Errors, returned from rejected promise

## redux actions
There are some actions you can react on:
- **LOAD** data loading for particular key is started
- **LOAD_SUCCESS** data loading process successfully finished. You'll have data returned from promise
- **LOAD_FAIL** data loading process was failed. You'll have error returned from promise
- **CLEAR** data for particular key was cleared
- **BEGIN_GLOBAL_LOAD** loading for all components began
- **END_GLOBAL_LOAD** loading for all components finished
